## Context Engineering Term Origins

The term **"Context Engineering"** has multiple contributors who helped establish it as a foundational concept in AI development:

### Primary Contributors

- **Tobi Lütke (Shopify CEO)** - Credited by the community as one of the original coiners of the term
- **Walden Yan (Cognition)** - Wrote the foundational blog post distinguishing context engineering from prompt engineering
- **Andrej Karpathy** - Popularized the term with his definition: *"the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step"*
- **Harrison Chase (LangChain)** - Provided key industry definition: *"building dynamic systems to provide the right information and tools in the right format such that the LLM can plausibly accomplish the task"*
