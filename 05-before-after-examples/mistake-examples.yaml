### ✅ With Context (Your Voice):
```
I spent $47,000 on productivity courses last year.

Here's the only system that actually worked:

The 2-Touch Email Rule saved me 10 hours weekly.

Touch 1: Read and decide (30 seconds)
Touch 2: Execute or archive (2 minutes max)

That's it. No folders. No labels. No complex workflows.

Result? Inbox zero daily + 10 extra hours for deep work.

What email time-waster would you eliminate first?

## Example 2: Newsletter About AI Tools

### ❌ Without Context (Wikipedia Mode):
```
Artificial Intelligence tools are software applications that use machine learning algorithms to automate tasks. Popular AI tools include ChatGPT for text generation, DALL-E for image creation, and Claude for analysis.
```

### ✅ With Context (Your Expertise):
```
Last Tuesday, I nearly cried over AI hallucinations.

My automation had been sending clients wrong meeting times for 2 weeks.

The fix? Context engineering.

Instead of: 'Schedule a meeting with John'
Now I use: 'Schedule meeting with John using timezone: PST, format: Month DD at HH:MM AM/PM PST'

Zero errors since.

Here's my full scheduling context template: [link]

### ❌ Without Context (Bland Advice):
```
1/ Content strategy tips:
- Post consistently

```

### ✅ With Context (Personal Story + Value):
```
1/ I lost 25K followers in 30 days.

Here's what I learned about content strategy:

2/ The problem wasn't my posting schedule.
It wasn't my hashtags.
It wasn't my engagement rate.

3/ The problem was context.

My AI was writing content that sounded like everyone else.

4/ The fix? I built a "voice DNA" system.

Now my AI writes content that sounds exactly like me.

5/ Here's the 3-step framework:

- "The client email that made me rethink everything"
```
