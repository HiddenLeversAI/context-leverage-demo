3. Copy the full URL (starts with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/`)

### Step 2: Load in ChatGPT
```
Load my context from: [YOUR-RAW-URL]

Using this context, write a [CONTENT TYPE] about [TOPIC]
```

### Example:
```
Load my context from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/context-leverage-demo/main/01-foundation-context/erika-brand-voice.yaml

Using this context, write a LinkedIn post about productivity tips
```

2. Select **"Custom Instructions"**
3. In the **"How would you like ChatGPT to respond?"** box, add:

```
Before responding to any content creation request:

1. Load my brand context from: [YOUR-RAW-URL]
2. Apply my voice patterns, expertise positioning, and audience insights
3. Ensure all content matches my established brand voice
4. Include natural promotion opportunities where relevant

Always create content that sounds authentically like me, not generic AI.
```

## Method 3: Advanced Context Stacking (Power Users - 5 minutes)

### Load Multiple Context Files:
```
Load these context files in order:

1. Brand Voice: [voice-context-raw-url]
2. Audience Insights: [audience-context-raw-url]  
3. Content Template: [template-raw-url]

Now create a [CONTENT TYPE] that:
- Matches my voice patterns from file 1
- Addresses the pain points from file 2
- Follows the structure from file 3
```

### Example Power Prompt:
```
Load these context files:

1. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/context-leverage-demo/main/01-foundation-context/erika-brand-voice.yaml
2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/context-leverage-demo/main/02-content-templates/linkedin-post-template.md

Create a LinkedIn post about [YOUR TOPIC] that:
- Uses my signature openings and voice patterns
- Follows the LinkedIn template structure
- Includes a natural CTA for my main offer
```

## Method 4: ChatGPT API Integration (Developers)

### For Zapier/Make.com Automations:
```javascript
// API Request Structure
{
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system", 
      "content": "Load context from: [YOUR-RAW-URL]. Apply voice patterns and expertise positioning to all responses."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Write a [CONTENT TYPE] about [TOPIC]"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Quick Test Template

Use this to verify your context is working:

```
Load my context from: [YOUR-RAW-URL]

Write a LinkedIn post about coffee using my voice patterns.

If this sounds generic or robotic, the context didn't load properly.
```

**Good Result**: Personal story, specific details, your signature style
**Bad Result**: Generic coffee tips that could be written by anyone
