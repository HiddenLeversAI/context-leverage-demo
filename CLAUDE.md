> **This is a demonstration of the Context Leverage system by Content Leverage OS©**

## Demo Overview

This repository demonstrates the core functionality of the Context Leverage system - a content automation framework that reduces creation time by 85% while multiplying content output by 5x.

**Key Demo Elements:**
- Brand voice inheritance patterns
- Template-based content generation
- Content multiplication workflows
- Real-world metrics and examples

## File Naming Conventions

The demo follows CLOS (Content Leverage OS) naming conventions:

- **Directories**: Use numbered prefixes for logical ordering (`01-foundation-context/`)
- **Files**: Use lowercase with hyphens, not underscores (`erika-brand-voice.yaml`)
- **Context Files**: End with `.yaml` for structured data
- **Templates**: Use `.md` with YAML frontmatter
- **Examples**: Include type prefix (`newsletter-to-social.yaml`)

## Customization Guide

To adapt this demo for your own use:

1. **Replace Brand Context** (`01-foundation-context/`)
   - Update `erika-brand-voice.yaml` with your brand parameters
   - Maintain the same structure for inheritance to work

2. **Modify Templates** (`02-content-templates/`)
   - Keep the YAML frontmatter structure
   - Update content sections for your niche
   - Ensure `inherits:` references your brand file

3. **Adapt Repurposing** (`03-repurposing-examples/`)
   - Modify source and target formats
   - Update transformation rules
   - Keep the automation workflow structure

## System Architecture

```
Context Flow:
Foundation Context → Templates → Repurposing → Output

Inheritance Pattern:
erika-brand-voice.yaml → newsletter-template.md → newsletter-to-social.yaml → social-posts
```

## Important Notes

- **Demo Simplification**: Templates are simplified for demonstration. The full system includes advanced features like:
  - 20+ brand voice parameters
  - A/B testing variants
  - Performance analytics integration
  - Advanced repurposing patterns (15+ formats)
  - Automated distribution workflows

- **Context Inheritance**: All templates inherit from the foundation context, ensuring brand consistency across all outputs

- **Production Differences**: This demo shows core concepts. The production system includes additional layers of optimization, analytics, and automation.

## Usage Instructions

1. Study the foundation context to understand parameter structure
2. Examine how templates inherit and extend the base context
3. Follow the repurposing examples to see content multiplication
4. Review sample outputs to understand transformation quality
